# Research Data Management

Agenda

Goals

* Brief introductions
* Why research data management
* Introduction to our narrative
* RDM lifecycle:
  * Planning
  * Data Acquisition
  * Storage & Analysis
  * Data Sharing & Archiving
* Closing remarks

Become familiar with the RDM lifecycle

Understand the details and requirements at each stage

Know what resources and services are available and recommended at HBS\, Harvard\, and beyond

Engage in utilizing best practices throughout your work at Harvard and in your future careers

# Why research data management?

Intro: Discussion Questions

Who can describe to me what Research Data Management is all about?

So what? Why should I care? Why should you care?

What’s in it for the faculty member? For the University?

Who might be partners in this endeavor?

Is anyone legally obligated?

What phases are part of the RDM lifecycle?

Data come in many ways…

“The  __active and ongoing__  management of data  __through __  __its lifecycle__  of interest and usefulness to scholarship\, science\, and education\.”

_— The University of Illinois’ Graduate School of Library and Information Science_

# Why should you care?

* _Benefits_  for yourself\, researchers\, and science:
* Your future self will thank you\!
* Facilitate and ensure seamless team transitions
* Conduct analysis effectively when collaborating with others
* Check and verify research results
* Support FAIR principles
  * Findable\, Accessible\, Interoperable\, & Reusable

_Compliance_ \, to minimize risks:

Be  __compliant with University and School policies__

Be  __compliant with research funding organizations __ that require a data management plan and data accessibility

Be  __compliant with journals __ that require to submit your data accompanying the article

# Your role as a Researcher…

Responsibility as a proxy for faculty researchers

Dual role of minding of administrative responsibilities and conducting the faculty research program

Provides a reference framework for how to conduct research in line with best practices

Practices aligned with career\- and established research professionals \(such as RCS personnel\)

You may have to exercise some\, many\, or all of the following recommendations…

_DISSEMINATION & PRESERVATION_

Evaluate & Archive

Share & Disseminate

__Store & Manage__

_PLANNING_

Plan & Design

Access & Reuse

__Store & Manage__

_ACTIVE_

__Store & Manage__

Collect & Create

Analyze & Collaborate

Data can be cyclical in use

Storage & management\, including security\, is central to all points in the cycle

RDM is a Collaborative Effort

_Your part in this is essential\!_

_But you have _

_partners that will help you during each step\!_

# Introduction to our Narrative

You have just come on board with a research group\. Its lead\, Professor Smith\, would like your help expanding on a previous research study she worked on five years ago with a different research associate\. In this study\, Professor Smith surveyed CEOs of fast\-casual restaurants \(e\.g\.\, Chipotle; Shake Shack\) to learn about their behaviors\. The data and code for this study were saved on the department’s research computing environment\, and you have been granted access to the files\.

Recently\, Professor Smith received a grant from the federal government to build upon this research by exploring what CEO\-reported behaviors from five years ago are related to current company financial records\. To explore this\, she will ask you to obtain company financial data compiled by a firm called FinanceCorp\. These data include confidential company financial data\, and are therefore considered extremely sensitive\. The FinanceCorp data will be merged with the data Professor Smith collected five years ago from company CEOs\.

In addition to you\, Professor Smith’s team also includes another professor from the University of Southern California\. As a result\, all of the files you receive and create for the project will need to be easily accessible to individuals outside of Harvard\.

Finally\, note that as a condition of receiving the grant to explore this topic area\, Professor Smith has agreed to de\-identify the data and make it available for public use at the conclusion of the study\.
