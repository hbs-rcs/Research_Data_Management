Dissemination & Preservation

# Discussion Questions

What data have you ever used that was originally collected by someone else?

Where did you find and access this data?

What is one thing \(in research or in life\) that you put somewhere for safekeeping but then couldn’t find later?

What have you heard before about reasons and requirements for preserving and sharing data?

# Options for Safeguarding Data Long-Term

* Not sure what to do with your data at the end of a project?
  * Retention requirements
  * HBS Faculty Papers Program
* Interested in sharing\, but not now?
  * Embargos
* Ready to share now
  * Data repositories
  * Baker Library Data Deposit Service for HBS Faculty
  * Harvard Library Data Curation Services
* Consultation service to help you decide may be available from your School

# What do I do with all the "stuff" from my project?

If you're not yet ready to think about data sharing\, but still want to secure your data\, the Library can help

# Research Data Retention

* How long do I need to keep research records?
* Harvard Office of the Vice Provost for Research
  * "Research Records should be retained\, generally\, for a period of no fewer than seven \(7\) years after the end of a research project or activity"
* What exactly is a "research record"?
* Transcripts of interviews
* Photographs
  * Videos/ audio files
  * Data \(qualitative and quantitative\)
  * Agreements with research subjects
  * Project proposals

# Long-term Storage

* For HBS Faculty\, Baker Library offers secure storage through the Faculty Papers Program\.
    * [https://www\.library\.hbs\.edu/Services/Faculty\-Papers\-Program](https://www.library.hbs.edu/Services/Faculty-Papers-Program)
* If keeping locally\, follow security protocols \(for example\, a locked cabinet for paper records; secure/restricted network space which is routinely backed up\)

# Archiving Data

![](images/RDM%20workshop%20slides28.png)

* __[HBS Archives](https://www.library.hbs.edu/Services/Archiving-Faculty-Research)__ [ ](https://www.library.hbs.edu/Services/Archiving-Faculty-Research)includes research papers of faculty that trace the innovations in business education pioneered at the Business School\.
* We collect for the HBS Archives research data with long term historical value/ importance to the School
* We can consult with HBS faculty members and help add their research to the HBS Archives collection\. We can place an "embargo" on access to meet privacy or other concerns\, but also ensuring this data is available for future researchers\.
* Other Archives
  * Inter\-university Consortium for Political and Social Research \(ICPSR\)

Comparison of Output with Hours of Sleep\, ca\. 1930\.  Western Electric Company Hawthorne Studies Collection\.

# Why share?

* Increases your reputation and the visibility of your research
* Increases your impact and informs new research
* Because your data can be cited:
  * Informs you on how you data is being used
  * Allows you to measure your greater impact
* Maximizes transparency\, accountability and scrutiny of research findings
* To ensure data can be re\-used\, work to make it FAIR:
  * Findable
  * Accessible
  * Interoperable
  * Reusable

# Data Deposit Service for HBS Faculty

Wherever HBS faculty want to share their data\, Baker Library staff will do the deposit\, including:

Help researchers select the best repository for their needs

Help researchers consider what data can be shared

Advise on preparing data and documentation

Liaise with the data repository

Deposit the files

Create repository metadata

[https://www\.library\.hbs\.edu/Services/Data\-Deposit\-Service](https://www.library.hbs.edu/Services/Data-Deposit-Service)

# Data Repositories for HBS

HBS Dataverse

Repository run by Harvard for sharing your data

Enables immediate sharing of data and associated documentation

Widely discoverable and citable with a DOI

Online analysis features for selected formats

Other data repositories\, e\.g\.\,:

ICPSR: full\-service data archive; expert in managing and providing restricted access to sensitive data

Journals may specify place of publication

# Harvard Library Research Data Management Program

__Mission__  __: Connect members of the Harvard community to services and resources that span the research data lifecycle\, to help ensure that Harvard’s multi\-disciplinary research data is findable\, accessible\, interoperable\, and reusable \(__  _[FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)_  __\)\.__

__GUIDING PRINCIPLES__

Connect a distributed network of services\, resources\, stakeholders & participants

Resource sharing: reduce duplication

Openness: communicate options

Scalability: assess needs\, scale services

Ease\-of\-access: minimize administrative barriers for users

__PROGRAM OBJECTIVES__

Serve the Harvard community across the research data lifecycle in 4 key areas

Services & Resources

Partnerships & Collaborations

Communications & Outreach

Communities of Practice

# Dissemination & Preservation Exercise

_Finally\, note that as a condition of receiving the grant to explore this topic area\, Professor Smith has agreed to de\-identify the data and make it available for public use at the conclusion of the study\._

As Professor Smith's new staff member\, take 5 minutes and discuss with your breakout group:

How might you figure out which of the project's data\, from the different sources\, can be shared publicly?

Given what else you have learned in this session\, how do you think you should organize and document your final data files so that they can be used by other researchers?

What type of features do you think Professor Smith would want in a data sharing repository?

# Dissemination & Preservation Recap

Think early and often about how you can keep your data organized and well\-documented _ while you're doing your research_ \, to save a ton of time at the end\.

You don't have to share your data to properly keep it\.

When you're thinking about what your faculty can do with their data long\-term\, think of Baker Library

We can help your faculty find a solution that meets their unique needs\-\-contact us for a consultation anytime as you're doing your research\.
